# How Next.js 15 Changes Web Development

Next.js 15 introduces several game-changing features that significantly improve the developer experience and application performance. In this post, we'll explore the most impactful changes and how they can benefit your projects.

## Turbopack: The New Standard

With Next.js 15, Turbopack is now the default bundler, offering incredible performance improvements over Webpack. Our team has seen build times decrease by up to 85% on large-scale projects, with hot module replacement (HMR) happening in milliseconds rather than seconds.

## React 19 Integration

The tight integration with React 19 allows developers to take full advantage of the latest React features, including:

* Server Actions for backend logic
* React Server Components for improved performance
* Streaming UI for enhanced user experiences

## How TELOS Implements Next.js 15

At TELOS, we've already migrated several client projects to Next.js 15, resulting in:

1. Faster page loads and better Core Web Vitals scores
2. Simplified codebase with better separation of concerns
3. Reduced server load and improved scalability

Stay tuned for more technical insights on our implementation approach in future posts!
