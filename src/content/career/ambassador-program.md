## How It Works

Team members can apply to become TELOS Ambassadors after their first six months with the company. Selected ambassadors receive specialized training and support to represent the company effectively.

Ambassadors commit to participating in at least 4 events per year and sharing their experiences with the broader team. In return, they receive dedicated time for preparation, travel expense coverage, and bonuses for successful representation.
